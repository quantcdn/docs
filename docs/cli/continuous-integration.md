title: Using Quant with CI
sidebar_label: CI pipelines

CI integration is a key area the CLI tool can assist with. When using a static builder your CI pipeline can be used to build and deploy content automatically as it changes.

For example, this documentation site is built with (Docusaurus)[https://v2.docusaurus.io/] and deployed to Quant via a (Codefresh)[https://codefresh.io/] CI pipeline.

Simply initialise Quant with a one-liner to prevent interactive setup with environment variables, e.g:
```
quant init -c ${QUANT_CUSTOMER} -t '${QUANT_TOKEN}' --project=${QUANT_PROJECT} -e 'https://api.quantcdn.io' -d ${BUILD_DIRECTORY}
```

Then run a Quant deployment to push content:
```
quant deploy
```
