Site-wide alerts allow you to add a site-wide banner at the top of every page.

This can be useful when using Quant as a failover solution, or for any other reason you need to inject a quick alert message site-wide without the need to re-seed all site content.

Navigate to the "Alert editor" section in the dashboard navigation. Simply enable and configure with title and message body (markup supported).

Use the CSS overrides to provide additional styling as required.
